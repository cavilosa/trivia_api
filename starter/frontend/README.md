# Full Stack API Second Project

## Full Stack Trivia API

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. This is a full stack application with backend and frontend directories.

What this application can:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains Flask and SQLAlchemy server.
All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
The backend runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

## Getting Started

Following commands are for bash command line on Windows 10.

### Authentication
This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Environment Variables

All environment variables are stored in the `.env` file and called in the code with `python-dotenv` library. In order to create the database path you will need your password, stored in the .env file in the root folder of the backend.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the Python 3.7 version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) as higher versions, like Python 3.9, are not supporting some of Flask functionality, at least for now.

#### Virtual Environment

It is recommend to work within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## Database Setup
From the backend folder with Postgres running (Windows) in bash CLI:
```bash
drop database trivia;
create database trivia;
```
Exit psql with ```\q``` and run this command to populate trivia database:
```bash
psql -d trivia -U postgres -a -f trivia.psql

```

## Create .env
Inside /backend folder create .env file with following variables to access your local database:
```bash
password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
username="YOUR_USERNAME"
```


## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment:
```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
or alternatively :
```bash
set FLASK_APP=flaskr && set FLASK_ENV=development && flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.


### Running FrontEnd

#### Installing Node.js and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. To install them run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Game Play Mechanics

The game designed to play all the questions in the category and will end when there are no more new questions to ask.


## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
},
{
  "error": 404,
  "messages": "resource not found",
  "success": false
},
{
  "error": 422,
  "messages": "You are trying to delete a question that does not exists in the database.",
  "success": false
},
{
   "success": False,
   "error": 500,
    "messages": "Internal server error."
}
```

The API can return these error types:

* 404 - resource not found,
* 400 - bad request,
* 422 - You are trying to delete a question that does not exists in the database,
* 500 - Internal Server Error.

psql -d trivia_test -U postgres -a -f trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

<!-- # Full Stack Trivia API  Frontend

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Required Tasks

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Request Formatting

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the ```components``` folder in order to edit the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses.

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to and update the frontend to make request and handle responses appropriately:
- Correct endpoints
- Update response body handling

## Optional: Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the ```stylesheets``` folder.

## Optional: Game Play Mechanics

Currently, when a user plays the game they play up to five questions of the chosen category. If there are fewer than five questions in a category, the game will end when there are no more questions in that category.

You can optionally update this game play to increase the number of questions or whatever other game mechanics you decide. Make sure to specify the new mechanics of the game in the README of the repo you submit so the reviewers are aware that the behavior is correct.  -->
